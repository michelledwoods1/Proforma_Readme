# Proforma README

## Description

Using the 'Inquirer package', create a command-line application that will quickly and dynamically create a professional, high-quality README.md file from the user's input.

The application will allow developers to quickly create a professional README for each new project, allowing them more time to work on the project.

As the application wonâ€™t actually be deployed, a link will be provided, to a walkthrough video that demonstrates the code's functionality.

## What I learned
During the completion of this task, I learned:
- npm initializing
